## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a very curious and inquisitive bioinformatics scientist with innate desire to continuously learn and improve my skills. I know R and Python programing and have experience working with a variety of next generation sequencing (NGS) data sets, but my main expertise is RNAseq.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning at the Data Science Institute, University of Toronto. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on scRNA-seq projects.
